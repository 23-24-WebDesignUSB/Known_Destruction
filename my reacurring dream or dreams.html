		my recuring dream or dreams

	</h1>

	<p>
		About three things happen when I fall asleep; ether I see myself in third person with what i did through out the day for the things in my sightline (like a phantom flying around unseen), I plan (subconsosly) what im going to do the next day, like in a videogame, or nothing happens and i wake up at 6 in the morning like i had just layed my head on my pillow.
